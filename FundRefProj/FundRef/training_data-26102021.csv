"This research is based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained from the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. The original HST observations are associated with program GO-13305. Observations have also been obtained from the Hubble Legacy Archive, which is a collaboration between the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI/NASA), the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF/ESAC/ESA) and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC/NRC/CSA). In particular, data were obtained from HST programs GO-13671 and GO-14098. Support for Program GO-13305 was provided by NASA through a grant from the Space Telescope Science Institute. A crucial part of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership between the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. Observations presented here have included results from the KCWI and NIRC2 instruments, under programs H305 and H315, part of the observing time allotment made by the University of Hawaii system (and the Institute of Astronomy) to U Hawaii, Hilo for educational and research training purposes following the decommissioning and removal of the UH Hilo teaching telescope from the summit of Mauna Kea. We greatly appreciate the help of Luca Rizzi with the calibrations and observations. Data from the KCWI were analysed using the KCWI Data Reduction Pipeline. The results presented here are also partly based on observations obtained at the international Gemini Observatory, a program of the NSF NOIRLab, which is managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation on behalf of the Gemini Observatory partnership. Gemini data were obtained in 2017 and 2018 under programme number GN-2017A-Q-48 which was also part of the observing time allotment made by the University of Hawaii system (and the Institute of Astronomy) to U Hawaii, Hilo for educational and research training purposes following the decommissioning and removal of the UH Hilo teaching telescope from the summit of Mauna Kea. We acknowledge the help of Andrew Stephens with the queue-scheduled observations. Gemini data were analysed using the GMOS-N and the NIRC-2 data reduction and analysis pipelines, operated within IDL. We have made use of the following databases: the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST); the SDSS, Data Release 12; the Pan-STARRS survey archived at the Hubble Legacy Archive, the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), and NASA’s Astrophysics Data System Abstract Service (ADS). This research has also made use of data and/or software provided by the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC), which is a service of the Astrophysics Science Division at NASA/GSFC. All spectra presented here were produced using SAOImage DS9, for which development has been made possible by funding from NASA’s Applied Information Systems Research Program, Chandra X-ray Science Center (CXC), and the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Center (HEASARC).
